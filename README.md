# Serve ⚡️

> This is nothing to be used in production, just playing around in this.

This repo has a frontend and a backend (in "server"). The backend just has a `GET` to `/` executed from the frontend. The frontend then loads the returned HTML.

Here's the plans:

- [X] Create a basic frontend to fetch HTML from backend
- [ ] Support scripts in the returned HTML
- [ ] Add a support for components
- [ ] Write an internal libary in it
- [ ] Create a full-stack app with it
- [X] Have fun and learn
