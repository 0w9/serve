# Serve ⚡️

> This is nothing to be used in production, just playing around.

This repo has a front and backend (in `server`). The backend has a `GET` to `/` executed (fetched) from the frontend. The frontend then loads the returned HTML.

Here are the plans:

- [X] Create a basic frontend to fetch HTML from the backend
- [ ] Support scripts in the returned HTML
- [ ] Add support for components
- [ ] Write an internal library in it
- [ ] Create a full-stack app with it
- [X] Have fun and learn
